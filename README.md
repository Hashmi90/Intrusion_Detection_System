# Intrusion-Detection-System

## Overview
The **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a network security application designed to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity and generate alerts when potential threats are detected. This project leverages Python programming for implementing the detection mechanisms and logging functionalities.

## Features
- Monitors network traffic in real-time.
- Detects known intrusion patterns.
- Logs detected intrusions for further analysis.
- Simple user interface for viewing logs.
- Supports both TCP and UDP traffic monitoring.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language for implementing the IDS.
- **Flask**: A micro web framework for building the user interface and serving the application.
- **Scapy**: A powerful Python library used for packet manipulation and network monitoring.
- **Git**: Version control system for managing project code.
- **GitHub**: Hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: For running the IDS and performing various tasks.

## Installation
To set up the Intrusion Detection System on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hashmi90/Intrusion_Detection_System.git
   cd Intrusion_Detection_System
Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have Python installed, then run:

pip install scapy
Run the IDS: To start monitoring your network, execute the following command:

python intrusion_detection_System.py
Usage
Once the IDS is running, it will monitor incoming and outgoing network packets. The system will log any suspicious activity detected based on predefined rules. To view the logs, you can check the logs/ directory created by the application.


How to Run the Intrusion Detection System (IDS)
Step 1: Clone the Repository
If you haven't cloned the repository yet, open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux) and run:

git clone https://github.com/Hashmi90/Intrusion_Detection_System.git
Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
Change to the directory where your project is located:

cd Intrusion_Detection_System
Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment
If you haven't already created a virtual environment, do so now. Run:

python -m venv venv

Step 4: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Step 5: Install Dependencies
Ensure that all required libraries are installed. If you haven't done this yet, run:

pip install Flask scapy
Step 6: Prepare the Logs Directory
Make sure you have a logs directory in the project root to store alert logs. If it doesn't exist, create it:

mkdir logs
Step 7: Run the Intrusion Detection Script
Open a new terminal window (or tab) to run the traffic monitoring script. Make sure the virtual environment is activated in this terminal as well.

Run the traffic detection script:

python intrusion_detection.py
This script will monitor network traffic and log any suspicious activity to logs/alerts.log.

Step 8: Run the Flask Application
In your original terminal (with the activated virtual environment), run the Flask web application:

python app.py
This will start a local web server.

Step 9: Open the Web Interface
Open your web browser and navigate to:


http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 
and to see alerts- http://127.0.0.1:5000/alerts
This URL will take you to the web interface where you can view alerts generated by the IDS.

Step 10: Simulate Network Traffic
While the intrusion_detection.py script is running, you can simulate network traffic to trigger alerts. The script will log any suspicious activity it detects.
How It Works
The IDS captures packets from the network using Scapy.
Each packet is analyzed for known intrusion signatures and anomalies.
When a potential threat is detected, an alert is generated, and the event is logged in a specified log file.
The system can be configured to recognize custom intrusion patterns.
Log Files
The IDS generates log files that contain details about detected intrusions. The logs include:

Timestamp: When the intrusion was detected.
Source IP: The originating IP address of the traffic.
Destination IP: The destination IP address of the traffic.
Protocol: The protocol used (TCP/UDP).
Description: A brief description of the detected intrusion.
Logs can be found in the logs/ directory, and each log entry provides valuable information for security analysis.

Future Enhancements
Implement machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection.
Develop a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user interaction.
Integrate with other security systems for comprehensive monitoring.
Enhance logging mechanisms to include more details.
